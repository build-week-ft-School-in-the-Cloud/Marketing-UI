What is School in the Cloud?
---

**School in the Cloud** is a platform that provides tools for students and volunteers to connect with one another. A platform where the number of students far outweigh the number of volunteers (high student to volunteer ratio) where the volunteers can teach anything and the students can learn anything. Volunteers of a higher age group are marketed so that those individuals who have experience in something, can teach something - even though, they've been out of the game for some time. To help bring opportunities to volunteers that may not have any because of their advanced age.
